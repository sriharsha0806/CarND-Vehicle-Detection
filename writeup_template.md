**Vehicle Detection Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. 
* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/513/view) Points
###Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

###Writeup / README

####1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Vehicle-Detection/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.  

You're reading it!

###Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

####1. Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images.

The code for this step is contained in the fifth code cell of the IPython notebook of main.
I started by reading in all the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` images.  Here is an example of one of each of the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` classes:

![alt text][image1]

I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.

Here is an example using the `YCrCb` color space and HOG parameters of `orientations=8`, `pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)` and `cells_per_block=(2, 2)`:

####2. Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters.

I tried various combinations of parameters and my code for same parameters as mentioned above excpet for colorspace which is  rgb is recognizing the vehicles for a few occasions in video. In test_images it is reconizing the front end of driving car. I tried changing various parameters and cropped the image. The result is my alogrithm is able to recognize the cars in test images.

####3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features (and color features if you used them).

I trained a linear SVM using three features. They are spatial_binning, histogram and HOG features. I wanted to implement decision features as mentioned by arpan in videos to reduce the feature vector further.

Feature vector length: 2492

###Sliding Window Search

####1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?

I decided to search random window positions at random scales all over the image and came up with this (ok just kidding I didn't actually ;):

![alt text][image3]

####2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?

Ultimately I searched on several scales using YCrCb 3-channel HOG features plus spatially binned color and histograms of color in the feature vector, which is a nice result.  (Here are some example images:)

### Video Implementation

####1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)
Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)


####2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.

My code is hardly able to detect the cars in images, so i didnot care much about false positives. If you review the output of the project video. You can see there are no false positives. 

### Here the resulting bounding boxes are drawn onto the last frame in the series:

### YOLO Implementation
I initially though of implementing msccn -A Unified Multi-scale Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Fast Object Detection. I would like to implement this alogrithm in future. I came across code by https://github.com/xslittlegrass/CarND-Vehicle-Detection . So i implemented code based on following link.  Yolo reframes object detection as a single regression problem, straight from image pixels to bounding boxes and class probabilities for those boxes. YOLO trains on full images and directly optimizes detection performance.

The tiny yolo v1 is consist of 9 convolution layers and 3 full connected layers. Each convolution layer consists of convolution, leaky relu and max pooling operations. There are a total of 45,089.374 parameters in the model and the detail of the architecture is in list in the table

I implemented some basic preprocessing steps for a improving performance.Selecting the region of interest and normalizing image values to -1 to 1. I have used pretrained weights. The model was trained on pascal VOC dataset. PASCAL VOC has 20 labelled classes so C=20.
The structure of the 1470 length tensor is as follows:
* First 980 values corresponds to probabolities for each of the 20 classes for each grid cell. These probabilities are conditioned on objects being present in each grid cell.The next 98 values are confidence scores for 2 bounding boxes predicted by each grid cells and the final values are co-ordinates for 2 bounding boxes per grid cell.

###Discussion

####1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

I tried to change and see if my algorithm is able to recover any cars from the test image as much as possible. My algorithm is not robust. It is still able to recognize the car in video frames in a few occasions.The SVC accuracy for various parameters is ranging from 99.35 to 99.55. Initially i thought it is overfitting, but to my surprise it not able to recognize the cars even after tweaking parameters a lot of times. So I tried to implement the yolo net.
